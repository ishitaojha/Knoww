      STEM Education, at its core, simply means educating students in four specific disciplines, namely, Science,
      Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (collectively shortened as STEM). Instead of training students in any one
      of these domains, STEM combines all four in an interdisciplinary and applied approach, so as to better equip
      students to have a career and considering real-world applications.

        <br>
        <p class="lead">Women and non-binary continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and
          math (STEM). Gender discrimination and gender bias reinforce cultural stereotypes about women and their
          ability to perform in male-dominated STEM fields. Greater policy intervention can bolster national response to
          gender-based harassment and discrimination. There are four major efforts that individual institutions, local
          governments, and the federal government can support to combat gender discrimination in STEM: (1) invest in
          early education initiatives for increasing female representation,(2) institute stronger state and federal
          policies around gender discrimination, (3) foster workplace practices that promote diversity, and (4) develop
          better quantification and metrics for assessing gender discrimination to enact more meaningful policies.

              Girls and women remain substantially under-represented in mathematics, science, and technology in school
              and in the workplace. Although this problem is recognized, its complexity is widely underestimated and
              causes are not well understood. We review prevailing explanations, which tend to concentrate either on
              possible gender differentials in qualities such as self-confidence, or on school practices that allow boys
              to dominate classroom interaction and monopolize such technology as computers.

              How LGBT+ scientists would like to be included and welcomed in STEM workplaces
            </h2>

            <p>
              ‘Invisible’: that is how many scientists from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) describe their status
              at their institution, laboratory, classroom or office. Sexual orientation and sexual and gender identity
              are not common topics of conversation in many science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
              workplaces, and these scientists argue that they should be. They say that cloaking an important part of
              their identity at work can have dangerous consequences for mental health and career advancement, both for
              individual scientists and for the disciplines that could drive them away.

              How to make STEM a safe place for trans and non-binary people
            </h2>


            <p>
              it’s time for STEM to invest in the trans and non-binary community. If your company or university doesn’t
              have trans or non-binary representation then there’s a good chance you’re unintentionally promoting a
              heteronormative, cisgender-oriented community. Because there’s a lot more trans and non-binary people out
              there than you think. If you’re not leaving the light on you shouldn’t be surprised when you can’t find
              them.
              <br>
              There’s a silver lining though. Workplaces and research labs that do decide to create safe spaces for
              trans and non-binary people stand a pretty good chance of finding out they’ve actually been there all
              along.
