## We need to understand that women and marginal genders are still facing issues in raising their voice

We have to help them gaining the confidence and support so that their can live freely althought not everyone faces issues in the workplace but Every one's struggle is different.

STEM Education, at its core, simply means educating students in four specific disciplines, namely, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (collectively shortened as STEM). Instead of training students in any one of these domains, STEM combines all four in an interdisciplinary and applied approach, so as to better equip students to have a career and considering real-world applications.

Women and non-binary continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Gender discrimination and gender bias reinforce cultural stereotypes about women and their ability to perform in male-dominated STEM fields. Greater policy intervention can bolster national response to gender-based harassment and discrimination. There are four major efforts that individual institutions, local governments, and the federal government can support to combat gender discrimination in STEM:

- invest in early education initiatives for increasing female representation,
- institute stronger state and federal policies around gender discrimination,
- foster workplace practices that promote diversity, and
- develop better quantification and metrics for assessing gender discrimination to enact more meaningful policies.

## Gender issue in Education for Science and Technology

Girls and women remain substantially under-represented in mathematics, science, and technology in school and in the workplace. Although this problem is recognized, its complexity is widely underestimated and causes are not well understood. We review prevailing explanations, which tend to concentrate either on possible gender differentials in qualities such as self-confidence, or on school practices that allow boys to dominate classroom interaction and monopolize such technology as computers.
